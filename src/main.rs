    // Enums and Pattern Matching

    // Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First, we’ll define and use
    // an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with data.

    // Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called Option, which expresses that a value
    // can be either something or nothing.

    // Then we’ll look at how pattern matching in the match expression makes it easy to run different
    // code for different values of an enum.

    // Finally, we’ll cover how the if let construct is another convenient and concise idiom available
    // to you to handle enums in your code.
